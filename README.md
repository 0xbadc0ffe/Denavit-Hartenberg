## Requirements

1. Python3 
	
	https://www.python.org/downloads/
	https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/
	
2. numpy library

	https://numpy.org/install/
	
	On Windows, if you got some errors from the numpy module this may be
	due to some Windows bug with numpy. In that case i suggest to install
